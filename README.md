### Changes to Wireframes:

During the development process some changes were made to the initial wireframes.

### Colors:

[ImaginecolorPicker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/) was used at first to establish a combination of colours that compliment each other. All of them were picked directly from the hero image.

<img src="assets/images/wireframes/Colours%20Picker.png" alt="Colour Chart" width="800" height="500"/>

### Images:

I carefully selected the pictures for the website to align with the overall aesthetic and convey a specific visual message. Each image was chosen for its relevance to the design industry and its ability to showcase various design elements and concepts. Here's an explanation of the image selection:

Hero Image: The hero image represents a visually stunning and captivating design that immediately captures the viewer's attention. It showcases the creativity and artistic flair that can be expected from the designer.

Meet the Team: The images chosen for the "Meet the Team" section reflect our commitment to showcasing the diverse talents and personalities of our design team. Each picture represents an individual team member and conveys their unique qualities and contributions to our collective expertise.

Latest Work Showcase: The portfolio section features a curated selection of design projects, highlighting different styles, disciplines, and techniques. Each project image is chosen to demonstrate versatility, innovation, and the ability to solve design problems effectively.

Overall, the selected images aim to create a visually appealing and cohesive representation of the designer's style, expertise, and passion for the field. They serve to engage and inspire visitors while showcasing the designer's capabilities and creating a strong visual impact.
