CREATIVE DESIGN is a responsive website that allows visitors to seamlessly view it on a wide range of devices. It serves as a platform to showcase skills, abilities, experiences, and accomplishments to potential employers, clients, or collaborators. By doing so, it helps establish a robust online presence and create a professional brand image that aligns with values, mission, and target audience.

### DESIGN:

## Wireframes:

I mainly stuck to the wireframe designs, all changes that were made were to improve the website user expierence and aesthetic.
The wireframes for this project were developed using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).

| Mobile | Desktop|

| [Mobile Contact Page](assets/images/wireframes/Contact%20-Mobile.png) | [Desktop Contact Page](assets/images/wireframes/Contact%20-%20Desktop.png) |

## Changes to Wireframes:

During the development process some changes were made to the initial wireframes. 

## Content responsiveness:
This portfolio has been designed with content responsiveness in mind, to ensure that it looks great and is easy to use across a wide range of devices and screen sizes.

To achieve this, the site layout and design are built using responsive design principles and are optimized for a variety of screen sizes, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices. This means that the content will automatically adjust and adapt to fit the size and shape of the user's screen, ensuring that it is always easy to read and navigate.

In addition, the site's images and multimedia content are optimized for fast loading times and compatibility with a range of devices and browsers. This means that users on slow connections or older devices will still be able to access and enjoy the portfolio's content without any issues.

Overall, this portfolio has been designed to provide a seamless and enjoyable user experience, regardless of the user's device or screen size. If you encounter any issues with content responsiveness or have any suggestions for improvement, please feel free to reach out and let me know.

## Colour Scheme:

[ImaginecolorPicker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/) was used at first to establish a combination of colours that compliment each other. All of them were picked directly from the hero image.

## Existing Features:


## Features Left to Implement:
 * Use javascript to perform return to top page.
 * Use javascript and listeners to require at least one checkbox to be checked before submitting the form on contact us page.

## Images:

I carefully selected the pictures for the website to align with the overall aesthetic and convey a specific visual message. Each image was chosen for its relevance to the design industry and its ability to showcase various design elements and concepts. Here's an explanation of the image selection:

Hero Image: The hero image represents a visually stunning and captivating design that immediately captures the viewer's attention. It showcases the creativity and artistic flair that can be expected from the designer.

Meet the Team: The images chosen for the "Meet the Team" section reflect our commitment to showcasing the diverse talents and personalities of our design team. Each picture represents an individual team member and conveys their unique qualities and contributions to our collective expertise.

Latest Work Showcase: The portfolio section features a curated selection of design projects, highlighting different styles, disciplines, and techniques. Each project image is chosen to demonstrate versatility, innovation, and the ability to solve design problems effectively.

Overall, the selected images aim to create a visually appealing and cohesive representation of the designer's style, expertise, and passion for the field. They serve to engage and inspire visitors while showcasing the designer's capabilities and creating a strong visual impact.
